Title: Keeps track of many simulation replications
Version: 0.2
Authors@R: "Derek Sonderegger <derek.sonderegger@nau.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: Manages the file creation of multiple replications of a simulation study so that a simulation can easily be extended to a larger number of replications or to restart an interrupted study. The simulations are run under a parallel processing loop, spreading the simulations across all possible processors. 
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), dplyr, stringr, foreach, doParallel
